1. Install Edge if needed.
2. Open P1.min.html file latest version in browser
3. Check your local network ip address ( i.e. on that device or another ) i.e. 192.168.1.xxx or 192.168.178.xxx  is used on your network, ip number sgiven out by  your DHCP server ( router )
4. If you do not know the ip number of your P1 Homewizard ( you can find it in the standard app of Homewizard ) you can use the
   SCAN function filling in i.e. 192.168.178.*   ( the last number as wildcard * ) . pressing the SCAN function will try to find the P1 meter.
   When found the IP number will be completed.
5. Press Start and the values should be read/ printed on the screen every second. 
    If you have gas, every 5 minutes a value comes from the P1 Homewizard meter and is shown in table and graph.
6. You can STOP anytime. App/page will run max. 1 day. Initial coding was made for 1 minute. Improvements still have to be made for the longer times of usage...
7. Pressing the ZOOM button will not show ALL data in the graph, but only the last 28 measurements of electr. usage.
  Using the slider you can go to earlier measurements. Toggeling the Zoom off again will show all data ( disregarding the slider )
8. Gas table is showing data and some calculations...
9. Mouseover the SCAN button shows extra info.
   Mouseover the points show label info. l1 l2 l3 with value or Tot. ( cummulated l1+l2+l3 value ) or in the Gas graph, that value.

      No Water meter info has been programmed yet.
      No additional Homewizard meters are programmed yet.
